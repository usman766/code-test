# Code Optimization and Refactoring

## Changes

1. **Database Queries**: We optimized database queries using Laravel's Eloquent ORM, reducing unnecessary queries and improving performance.

2. **Readability**: Complex code blocks were refactored into smaller, clearer functions. We also improved variable names.

3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms were implemented to handle exceptions gracefully and provide helpful error messages.

4. **Performance**: We identified and fixed performance bottlenecks, making our code more efficient. Caching was used where appropriate to speed up data retrieval.

5. **Code Reusability**: Common code segments were extracted into reusable functions or classes, reducing duplication and making our code easier to maintain.

These changes aim to enhance our codebase's quality and make it more reliable for future development.
